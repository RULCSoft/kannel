Kannel's upstream source package is distributed with the name
gateway-x.y.z.tar.gz; since this name does not fit into Debian's packaging
standards correctly, I have renamed it to kannel_x.y.z.tar.gz
(kannel_x.y.z.orig.tar.gz).

Additionally, the upstream tarball contains a debian/ directory; I have
removed this directory in the Debian tarball.
